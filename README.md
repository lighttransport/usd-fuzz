# PoC/Regression USD files for fuzzing USD library.

At the moment, PoC/Regression files are primarily for TinyUSDZ https://github.com/syoyo/tinyusdz

No update means no PoC found, which means TinyUSDZ is stable.

No USDA PoCs so far(as of 15th Dec, 2022), since no seg fault found in TinyUSDZ's Ascii parser.

## Copus file

To be prepared.
